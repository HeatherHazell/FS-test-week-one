# Full Stack Development Test - Week One

This assessment tests your understanding of loops, objects, arrays, and basic functions.

## Guidelines

- In case you copy previously written code, you should be able to explain it on the white board

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade  | Explanation              |
| :----: | -------------------------|
|   4    | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3    | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2    | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer. |
|   1    | I am struggling with this question. |
|   0    | I did not attempt this question (explain why) |

### 1. Palindrome

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: In my attempts I was part way there in both. My first attempt I was taking the word and reversing it. In the second, I was comparing the reversed but they were not the same type (a string and a integer). I then joined the two attempts to get my final answer.

### 2. Add grid items

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: This was not as bad as I thought after first reading what the problem was asking. I referred back to the notes/lectures and came up with it pretty easily, though, I will be revisiting grids in my review this weekend. 

### 3. Create file name string in CamelCase

- Grade: 4
- Explanation: This was at first like whaaaat? I started trying to look up extension methods with JS - that didn't go well. I then just tried the items = pdf || png || json, thinking this isn't going to work - but it did! what a relief!

### 4. Create pattern

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: This was complicated. What I originally though the problem was asking me to do was to  make the loop start with 99 and deduct 3 for the length og 5 rows? It wasn't going well. Then when I started to do my last four loop (which may have worked if I'd finished it, but seemed more complicated), it occured to me that I could acccomplish this more easily by assign the numbers to an array (like in my last for loop attempt) and using a while loop and using pop() to remove the last element.

****Side note: My first hour I worked on this was rough. I needed to stop and walk away because I was getting no where. I get really stressed out/anxious when I am taking a timed test. But when I came back, I was in a much better state of mind to get these done.
